/*
Statement: Given a sequence represented by: 𝑥𝑖 = 3 ∗ 𝑖 − 1
So, the elements of the sequence are [2, 5, 8, 11, ….]
Write a program to find out the sum and the product of the first n elements of the sequence 
given an integer in range [1, ∞)

Solution: Declare an integer i as a counter, and initialize it to 1.
Iterate i from 1 to n. In each iteration, calculate the i-th element using the formula given.
Update the sum and the product of all elements from the 1st to the i-th element.
Finally, print the sum and product of the elements.

int main() {
    int n, i = 1, sum = 0;
    long long product = 1;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    while (i <= n) { 
        int xi = 3 * i - 1;
        sum += xi;
        product *= xi;
        i++;
    }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
    printf("%lld", product);
